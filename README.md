## Custom Multilingual Organization Name Extraction using spaCy

This project focuses on building a custom NER model with spaCy to detect organization names from multilingual text messages commonly used in business and customer communication workflows.


## 🚀 Key Features

    1. **Custom Entity Tagging:**
    Labeled organization mentions (ORG) across text samples in multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Spanish), including transliterated and mixed-language patterns.

    2. **Model Training:**
    Fine-tuned spaCy’s transformer-based pipeline on the annotated dataset. Implemented token normalization and text augmentation to manage informal spellings, abbreviations, and mixed scripts.

    3. **Multilingual Understanding:**
    Leveraged multilingual embeddings to enhance generalization across languages, allowing robust organization name recognition even in partially translated or hybrid text messages.

    4. **Applications:**
    Useful for automating lead classification, CRM data enrichment, brand name extraction, and multilingual text analysis in enterprise systems.
